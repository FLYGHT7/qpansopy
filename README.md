# qpansopy
An opensource PANS OPS software implementation based on QGIS

Note: This code is in development and provided as is, it may contain errors and you are solely resposible for using it. Any feedback is welcome.
The implementation is done in a projected coordinate system and currently there is no intention to use a purely geodesic calculation.
