This directory tracks Pull Request documentation that is OPEN (not yet merged/closed).

Usage:

- Place new PR write-ups here while the PR is in review.
- When the PR is merged or closed, move the file to ../doc_pr_closed.

Tips:

- Keep filenames prefixed with the issue number or a short tag, e.g., PR*87*..., PR*60*...
- Include a short Status field at the top (e.g., Ready, Draft).
